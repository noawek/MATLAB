# MATLAB Portfolio - Course Projects and Assignments 📊💻
Welcome to my MATLAB portfolio! 🌟 This repository showcases the work I've completed in a MATLAB course as a part of my B.Sc., thus, the projects you'll see are mainly related to Psychobiology (Neuroscience). The course covered a range of topics in MATLAB programming, and the progress, from a basic level of programming to a very advanced one, is highly reflected when exploring the folders in ascending order. These projects and assignments demonstrate my skills in MATLAB and my ability to apply programming techniques to solve various problems. ⚙️📈
