% Load the EEG data:
load 'EEG_Data.mat';

% inserting electrodes as instructed (4 from each side of the occipital lobe): 
electrodes_left = [25,22,21,26];
electrodes_right = [62,63,58,59];

% a vector including them all:
all_electrodes = [electrodes_left,electrodes_right]; 

% creating the terms for ERP:
time_needed_before_stimulus_ms = 200;
time_needed_after_stimulus_ms = 600;
from_ms_to_s = 1000;
% the "srate" is measured as trials per second, but the times are given in
% milliseconds. thus, we want to have the time in seconds, so it can be used
% later to find the number of trials in a time frame. so, in order to devided 
% it by "srate" i had to turn the units to seconds (by deviding it in 1000).
time_needed_before_stimulus_s = time_needed_before_stimulus_ms/from_ms_to_s;
time_needed_after_stimulus_s = time_needed_after_stimulus_ms/from_ms_to_s;
trials_in_600_ms = round(time_needed_after_stimulus_s*EEG.srate);
trials_in_200_ms = round(time_needed_before_stimulus_s*EEG.srate);
intervalls_between_each_stimuli_in_ms = round(from_ms_to_s/EEG.srate);

% Extract the timing (EEG.event.latency) of events where stimulus was in the left visual field:
number_of_events = length(EEG.event);
left_events = [];
left_count = 0;
for i = 1:number_of_events
    if EEG.event(i).type == 2   % Stimulus was in left visual field
        left_count = left_count+1;
        left_events(left_count) = round(EEG.event(i).latency);
    end
end

% Cut the stimuli into segments according to stimulus presentation:
left_stimulus = [];
for i = 1:length(left_events)
    timestamp = left_events(i);
    for j = 1:length(all_electrodes)
    left_stimulus(i,:,j) = EEG.data(all_electrodes(j),timestamp-trials_in_200_ms:timestamp+trials_in_600_ms);   % Extract segments 200ms before and 600ms after stimulus onset
    end
end

% creating a matrix for all 8 electrodes ERP's:
ERP = squeeze(mean(left_stimulus));


%%% (B) %%%

% Normalizing the responses by using the avarage of the pre-stimulus interval 
% (the avarage of the responses from the first 200ms in the ERP i created 
% [before the stimulus appeared]) as baseline (different baseline for each electrode):
norm_ERP = [];
for i = 1:length(all_electrodes)
    prestim = squeeze(mean(ERP(1:trials_in_200_ms,i),1));
    norm_ERP(:,i) = ERP(:,i)-prestim;
end

% seperating the data according to the side it came from:
ERP_left_electrodes = norm_ERP(:,1:length(electrodes_left));
ERP_right_electrodes = norm_ERP(:,1+length(electrodes_left):length(electrodes_left)+length(electrodes_right)); 
% the +1 is there, so an electrode won't be included twice.
xtics = -time_needed_before_stimulus_ms:intervalls_between_each_stimuli_in_ms:time_needed_after_stimulus_ms;
% set numbers on x axis to fit the time in msec. the intervalls were calculated in advance.

% Since in this work we referred to the stimulus presented in the 
% left visual field, the expectation was that the right electrodes would 
% show a stronger response (than the left), due to brain crossover. 
% You can see this very clearly in the graphs produced in questions 2 and 3:

%%%% â€¢ In graph 2, all the ERPs of all the electrodes appear separately from each other,
% when the right ones appear together in the same subplot, as do the left ones. 
% Already here, we see a trend that reflects a sharper increase in brain activity after 
% the presentation of the stimulus on the right side of the brain (around p100).

%%%% â€¢ In addition, graphs 2 and 3 show the average ERPs for each 4 electrodes of a certain side. 
% This averaging allows us to look at the brain activity in the right/left occipital lobe 
% (separately), and compare the general activity on both sides as a response to the stimulus 
% presented in the left visual field. Here too, we see that there is a higher electrical (brain) 
% activity on the right side of the brain (as expected) at the time after the presentation of 
% the stimulus on the left. Furthermore, at the time when a reaction begins on the right side, 
% we also see a decrease in the electrical activity of the left side.

%%%% â€¢ Furthermore, graph 3 also shows the p100 values for each side of the occipital lobe, 
% which are actually the maximum values found in the range in which a brain response 
% (change in electrical activity) usually occurs, as a response to a certain stimulus. 
% Even in these values, you can clearly see a difference in the different p100 values 
% that each side has. The maximum value for the right side is relatively high and positive 
% (8.7135), while the maximum value for the left side in this range is even negative (-3.0934), 
% which really demonstrates how much higher the activity of the right side is (as expected).
